- fix vscode exclusively admin/non-admin windows problem
- windows (and ios?) app that fans can use to watch football streams with intuitive ui/ux to measure stoppage time themselves
- windows app that consumes a stream of eye tracking data from a given endpoint in a custom format (protocol?) (maybe use udt? quic?) to then generate Tobii-like visualisations overlayed on top of a target window (or the entire screen) for recording or streaming purposes -- the device providing the face recog data will need to track the location and orientation of the monitor in relation to the user's eyes as well as its own location and orientation (using gyro + object detection + face recog + math) -- would be nice to show a 3d model of this on the mobile device -- after all this it will need to do the actual eye tracking, use math and all the previously processed data to figure out where he is looking on the screen (math) and then serve the stream of eye tracking data.
- advent of code
- napkin math (first principles)
- protohackers
- ai tool that can take a song, and you can use your voice to change parts of it like change the underlying beat, or make the melody slightly different, or remove a layer from a song etc
- make multithreaded chatroom examples in multiple languages (nodejs, go, python, java, c#, rust, ocaml, elixir) and profile memory usage when: idle, 1k connections, 10k connections, 100k connections, 1M connections, 10M connections, 100M connections
- p2p stateful clipboard sharing
- make dark mode for various windows applications:
	  - system properties
	  - system information
	...etc.
- pddl planner for generating p2p strategies given:
	  - rules
	  - network conditions
	  - available actions
	  - state changes from those actions
- function history vscode extension (undo/redo within a function instead of changing other parts of the file)
- add ability to choose websocket server url from pairdrop frontend (just like in movie-web)

- video bleeper using transcription, `ffmpeg` and a list of bad words lol

- tydlig for web (excuse to use webgl/webgpu/wasm stuff `(or just use a wrapper which usually becomes the case)`
- barrier remake using wolf (sunshine rewrite) input code
- parsec arcade remake but using sunshine:
	- easy host ui for managing clients, permissions
	- ability to limit input to just one window
	- ability to limit input to vigem controller emulation
- openpgp based offline message encryption & decryption in a chrome extension:
	- Sending:
	  Have a text box for the user to type into, and once done, the text is encrypted using the receivers public key and copied to the actual text box that the site provides - potentially auto-sent as well.
	- Receiving:
	  Allow the user to decrypt received messages using their own private key.
