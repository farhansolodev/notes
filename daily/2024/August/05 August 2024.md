It seems that there are a number of ways to specialize the network stack for a single application and/or type of network:
- ## Virtual Network Interface + TCP tuning
  Linux (and perhaps Windows as well) allow users to do TCP tuning from userspace. However this tuning affects the networking of an entire NIC instead of it only being specific to an application. This might not be a viable solution when you want to preserve the general networking of other applications. A solution is to create a *virtual network interface*, do TCP tuning on that, and then bind only your application to that interface, so that other applications may continue to use the primary interface.
  This approach has a few potential roadblocks, and the actual process is more nuanced. [Kernel bypass - Virtualization Approach (cloudflare.com)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/kernel-bypass/#virtualizationapproach)is a good resource to read about these roadblocks.
- ## [UDT (UDP-based Data Transfer)](https://udt.sourceforge.io/doc/draft-gg-udt-03.txt)
  While TCP tuning can be used to specialize a network stack for a particular application and/or a type of network, UDT allows applications to provide it's own networking mechanisms with minimal overhead: by offering an unopinionated, standardized connection-oriented protocol on top of UDP.
  This has the benefit of allowing application developers to not have to set up virtual NICs on every production environment, and it also avoids the overhead of having a virtual NIC in the first place.
  
  Based on it's Internet-Draft submitted to the IETF:
  > The original motivation of UDT, is to overcome TCP's inefficiency in high bandwidth-delay product (BDP) networks[^1]. Another 
  > important target use scenario is to allow networking researchers, students, and application developers to easily implement and 
  > deploy new data transfer algorithms and protocols. Furthermore, UDT can also be used to better support firewall traversing.

  However, there are still reasons to use TCP instead of a custom protocol. A few of these reasons are listed on: [Why we use the Linux kernel's TCP stack - What about a full userspace TCP stack? (cloudflare.com)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-use-the-linux-kernels-tcp-stack#:~:text=What%20about%20a%20full%20userspace%20TCP%20stack%3F). To summarize:
  - *Minimal CPU wins*: maybe CF routers are quite expensive because of the traffic they take on, but shouldn't their main focus be more geared towards optimised traffic, like bandwidth utilisation, latency reduction, retransmission reduction, site reliability etc? #question
  - *Adoption issues*: alot of their existing tooling wouldn't work without a kernel space TCP stack
  - *Lack of firewall features*: they are CF after all, so they are the targets of all sorts of attacks
  - *Lack of non-trivial but critical features*: they just don't want to reinvent the wheel for non-trivial things i guess
  - *Apprehensive about debugging a young TCP stack*: the Linux TCP stack already has it's own bugs & quirks which are non-trivial to debug

The [KCP](https://github.com/skywind3000/kcp) library seems to be a competitor to UDT.
There is also a [Go implementation](https://github.com/xtaci/kcp-go) which is quite popular, but not nearly as popular as the original.

Another competitor called [enet](https://github.com/zpl-c/enet), whose first commit on this repo is in 2004, seems to be 10 years older than KCP and 6 years older than UDT (as per it's Internet-Draft).

The author of Syncthing had this to say on it's [Community Forum](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/connections-over-udp/9382) about KCP and reliable UDP protocols in general:
> There is a recurring theme that connections over UDP will give better performance than TCP. This is not the case - not in general, and very much not in our case. I know this will come up, so I want to take the time to walk through why it is not the case for us.
> 
> Certainly there are cases where a protocol over UDP will outperform TCP. It will do so in specific environments unsuited for TCP, and when the UDP-encapsulating protocol is optimized for exactly that environment. For example in very high performance supercomputer clusters, and in situations with very high latency and packet loss. Those are two vastly different environments though, and the protocols suited for one will perform very badly or not at all in the other.
> 
> However, TCP is typically faster for most things inbetween. There are a number of reasons:
> - Lack of a magic bullet. UDP is “faster” than TCP because it does not do ACKs or resends and will stream packets at whatever pace you decide instead of using windowing and congestion control. However, we need the resends, and the windowing, and the congestion control, and so on to make sure data arrives safely and to decide the pace at which we can send packets without dropping them immediately. This means that essentially everything TCP does must be implemented again, but now on top of UDP.
> - Optimization. TCP has been studied, tweaked and optimized by literally hundreds of people for the last 35 years. The on-top-of-UDP protocol we use has had maybe a person year or two of engineering put into it, best case.
> - Optimization, again. TCP is implemented in the kernel and, in part, in the network card. When using TCP we can make one call to the kernel to hand it a large buffer of data and say “segment and package this as you see fit”. When using UDP, because we have to do that segmenting and packaging ourselves, we hand each packet individually the kernel. Each call to the kernel is expensive and the overhead becomes very significant, especially in Go. The kernel’s TCP stack is also highly optimized for performance while the kernel’s UDP stack is typically not.[^2]

> All in all, you should expect KCP connections to have lower performance than TCP. Syncthing still defaults to TCP when it can be established, falling back to KCP when that is the only option. A KCP connection will however be significantly better than using a relay and being able to transparently connect through NAT devices increases Syncthing’s “fire and forget” ability significantly

What's interesting is despite work being done to integrate KCP into Syncthing, it was only done for NAT traversal purposes. Now however, it seems to have been swapped out for QUIC:

![[Pasted image 20240806033443.png|800]]
So even projects like Syncthing can get protocol choices wrong! 

#vpn #tun-tap
All in all, perhaps reliable UDP based protocols aren't meant for general use and instead for very specific scenarios, despite projects like [xtaci/kcptun: A Quantum-Safe Secure Tunnel based on QPP, KCP, FEC, and N:M multiplexing.](https://github.com/xtaci/kcptun) & [getlantern/lantern](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern) existing.

Most of KCP's marketing seems to be geared towards game netcode, so it makes sense that [MirrorNetworking/Mirror: #1 Open Source Unity Networking Library](https://github.com/MirrorNetworking/Mirror#made-with-mirror) is so popular.

[This](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22775513) is an interesting thought. I never considered you could just not use UDP at all and write a protocol directly on top of the Ethernet frames.

So [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/) is a security layer (firewall?) for containers. It implements its own network stack called `netstack`.
![[Pasted image 20240805173241.png|300]]

And TIL [Wireshark's Go implementation](https://github.com/WireGuard/wireguard-go)uses gVisor's `netstack`.

Pion's `transport` library consists of a [virtual network layer](https://github.com/pion/transport/tree/master/vnet) called `vnet` that was inspired by Wireshark's similiar use of `netstack`. It is mainly used to make NAT traversal tests easy.

[^2]: Perhaps the only place where KCP truly shines is over abhorrently unreliable WANs, when connection quality is abysmal. In this case these problems overshadow the drawbacks of KCP presented here.
