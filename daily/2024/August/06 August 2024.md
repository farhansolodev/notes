 Cloudflare WARP or as it is called now ,[1.1.1.1 â€” The free app that makes your Internet faster](https://one.one.one.one/), is a ~~forward proxy~~ VPN that aims to make your internet more stable by taking advantage of the fact that Cloudflare has physical infrastructure all over the world, and forwarding all your requests through Cloudflare's servers. ~~On the surface it seems to work like a VPN and on mobile at least it does in fact install a VPN profile, but Cloudflare still forwards your IP to the endpoints being accessed.~~ Despite installing a VPN profile (at least on mobile) to make it work, WARP used to be a forward proxy that would forward your IP to the requested endpoints. Now WARP is just like a traditional VPN, and those endpoints see a Cloudflare IP instead.
 
 ~~So it is only your ISP from whom destination endpoints are being hidden. It sounds like it is doing packet encapsulation, like IPSec, Teredo or AYIYA.~~

Packet encapsulation seems to be a pattern. It is utilised in:
- VPN protocols like IPSec
- IPv6 transition protocols Teredo & AYIYA

I found [XDP for Game Programmers (mas-bandwidth.com)](https://mas-bandwidth.com/xdp-for-game-programmers/), which apparently demonstrates a 3rd way to optimise traffic, instead of TCP-tuning or having a userspace TCP stack: you write a function that gets called at the very earliest point when a packet comes off the NIC, right before the Linux kernel does any allocations or processing for the packet.
