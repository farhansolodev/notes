So *S-expressions* are whatever Lisp-like languages look like. And the "killer app" of languages that use S-expressions, is the intuitiveness of *making other languages*, like DSLs for example.

This is why Lisp macros are apparently the best out of any language.

Apparently they can also very intuitively encode XML-like data, such as HTML or SVG, or even JSON for that matter - any data type that is nested. Racket (a Lisp-like) does exactly this and calls it *X-expressions*.
